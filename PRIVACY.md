# Privacy Policy


This app (Stroke Input Method) does not collect any personal data.

In particular:

- This app cannot send data over the internet,
  because it does not have network access permissions.

- This app does not learn user input for candidate prediction,
  as candidates are generated deterministically
  (there is no model/AI to train).

You are welcome and encouraged to inspect the source code at
<<https://github.com/stroke-input/stroke-input-android>>.
Should you find any vulnerabilities or privacy concerns,
please report to <<yawnocdev@pm.me>>.
