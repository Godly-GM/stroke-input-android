# stroke-input-android

An attempt at making an Android custom keyboard
for the Stroke Input Method (筆畫輸入法) in Chinese.

I do not expect this to be completed any time soon.
Eventually the plan is to utilise the "yawnoc" stroke data set
that I am currently compiling in [stroke-input-data].


## Licensing

This repository is licensed under GPL-3.0-only, see [LICENSE].

The font used on the keyboard is modified
from an Apache 2.0 version of Noto Sans CJK TC,
see [noto-sans-cjk-tc-fix].
